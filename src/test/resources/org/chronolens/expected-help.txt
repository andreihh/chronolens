Usage: chronolens [-hV] [COMMAND]
ChronoLens is a software evolution analysis tool that inspects the repository
detected in the current working directory.
  -h, --help      Show this help message and exit.
  -V, --version   Print version information and exit.
Commands:
  ls-tree           Prints all the interpretable files of the repository from
                      the specified revision.
  rev-list          Prints all revisions on the path from the currently
                      checked-out (<head>) revision to the root of the revision
                      tree / graph in chronological order.
  model             Prints the interpreted model of the source node with the
                      specified id as it is found in the given revision of the
                      repository.
  persist           Connects to the repository and persists the source and
                      history model from all the files that can be interpreted.
  clean             Deletes the previously persisted repository from the
                      current working directory, if it exists.
  decapsulations    Loads the persisted repository, detects the decapsulations
                      that occurred during the evolution of the project and
                      reports the results to the standard output.
  divergent-change  Loads the persisted repository, builds the temporal
                      coupling graphs for the analyzed source files, detects
                      the Divergent Change instances, reports the results to
                      the standard output and dumps the coupling graphs for
                      each source file in the '.chronolens/divergent-change'
                      directory.
  hotspots          Loads the persisted repository, detects the hotspots of the
                      system and reports the results to the standard output.
  help              Displays help information about the specified command
